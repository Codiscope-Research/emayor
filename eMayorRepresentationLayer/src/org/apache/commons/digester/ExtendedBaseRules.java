/**
 * <p>Extension of {@link RulesBase} for complex schema.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is an extension of the basic pattern matching scheme
 * intended to improve support for mapping complex xml-schema.
 * It is intended to be a minimal extension of the standard rules
 * big enough to support complex schema but without the full generality
 * offered by more exotic matching pattern rules.</p>
 *
 * <h4>When should you use this rather than the original?</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * This pattern-matching engine is complex and slower than the basic
 * default RulesBase class, but offers more functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Universal patterns allow patterns to be specified which will match
 *  regardless of whether there are "better matching" patterns available.</li>
 * <li>Parent-match patterns (eg "a/b/?") allow matching for all direct
 *  children of a specified element.</li>
 * <li>Ancestor-match patterns (eg "a/b/*") allow matching all elements
 *  nested within a specified element to any nesting depth.</li>
 * <li>Completely-wild patterns ("*" or "!*") allow matching all elements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Universal Match Patterns</h4>
 * 
 * <p>The default RulesBase pattern-matching engine always attempts to find
 * the "best matching pattern", and will ignore rules associated with other
 * patterns that match but are not "as good". As an example, if the pattern
 * "a/b/c" is associated with rules 1 and 2, and "*&#47;c" is associated with
 * rules 3 and 4 then element "a/b/c" will cause only rules 1 and 2 to execute.
 * Rules 3 and 4 do have matching patterns, but because the patterns are shorter
 * and include wildcard characters they are regarded as being "not as good" as
 * a direct match. In general, exact patterns are better than wildcard patterns,
 * and among multiple patterns with wildcards, the longest is preferred.
 * See the RulesBase class for more information.</p>
 *
 * <p>This feature of preferring "better" patterns can be a powerful tool.
 * However it also means that patterns can interact in unexpected ways.</p>
 *
 * <p>When using the ExtendedBaseRules, any pattern prefixed with '!' bypasses 
 * the "best match" feature. Even if there is an exact match or a longer 
 * wildcard match, patterns prefixed by '!' will still be tested to see if 
 * they match, and if so their associated Rule objects will be included in
 * the set of rules to be executed in the normal manner.</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Pattern <code>"!*&#47;a/b"</code> matches whenever an 'b' element
 *     is inside an 'a'.</li>
 * <li>Pattern <code>"!a/b/?"</code> matches any child of a parent
 *     matching <code>"a/b"</code> (see "Parent Match Patterns").</li>
 * <li>Pattern <code>"!*&#47;a/b/?"</code> matches any child of a parent
 *     matching <code>"!*&#47;a/b"</code> (see "Parent Match Patterns").</li>
 * <li>Pattern <code>"!a/b/*"</code> matches any element whose path
 *     starts with "a" then "b" (see "Ancestor Match Patterns").</li>
 * <li>Pattern <code>"!*&#47;a/b/*"</code> matches any elements whose path
 *     contains 'a/b' (see "Ancestor Match Patterns").</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h4>Parent Match Patterns</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * These will match direct child elements of a particular parent element.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  <code>"a/b/c/?"</code> matches any child whose parent matches
 *  <code>"a/b/c"</code>.  Exact parent rules take precedence over Ancestor
 *  Match patterns.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  <code>"*&#47;a/b/c/?"</code> matches any child whose parent matches
 *  <code>"*&#47;a/b/c"</code>.  The longest matching still applies to parent
 *  matches but the length excludes the '?', which effectively means
 *  that standard wildcard matches with the same level of depth are
 *  chosen in preference.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Ancestor Match Patterns</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * These will match elements whose parentage includes a particular sequence
 * of elements.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  <code>"a/b/*"</code> matches any element whose path starts with
 *  'a' then 'b'. Exact parent and parent match rules take precedence. 
 *  The longest ancestor match will take precedence.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  <code>"*&#47;a/b/*"</code> matches any elements whose path contains
 *  an element 'a' followed by an element 'b'. The longest matching still 
 *  applies but the length excludes the '*' at the end.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Completely Wild Patterns</h4>
 *
 * <p>Pattern <code>"*"</code> matches every pattern that isn't matched by
 * any other basic rule.</p>
 *
 * <p>Pattern <code>"!*"</code> matches every pattern.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Using The Extended Rules</h4>
 *
 * <p>By default, a Digester instance uses a {@link RulesBase} instance as
 * its pattern matching engine. To use an ExtendedBaseRules instance, call
 * the Digester.setRules method before adding any Rule objects to the digester
 * instance:
 * <pre>
 *     Digester digester = new Digester();
 *     digester.setRules( new ExtendedBaseRules() );
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * <p>The most important thing to remember when using the extended rules is 
 * that universal and non-universal patterns are completely independent.
 * Universal patterns are never affected by the addition of new patterns
 * or the removal of existing ones. Non-universal patterns are never affected
 * by the addition of new <em>universal</em> patterns or the removal of 
 * existing <em>universal</em> patterns. As in the basic matching rules, 
 * non-universal (basic) patterns <strong>can</strong> be affected by the 
 * addition of new <em>non-universal</em> patterns or the removal of existing 
 * <em>non-universal</em> patterns, because only rules associated with the
 * "best matching" pattern for each xml element are executed.
 *
 * <p> This means that you can use universal patterns to build up the simple 
 * parts of your structure - for example defining universal creation and 
 * property setting rules. More sophisticated and complex mapping will require 
 * non-universal patterns and this might mean that some of the universal rules 
 * will need to be replaced by a series of special cases using non-universal 
 * rules. But by using universal rules as your backbone, these additions 
 * should not break your existing rules.</p>
